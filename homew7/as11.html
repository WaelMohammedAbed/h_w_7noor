           SCENE Capture is optimized for the usage on tablet computers with a touch screen. The application guides the user through the scanning and post-processing for various hand held sensors. The results are visualized immediately to provide a real-time feedback. The user is always aware which parts of the scene are captured already.

The post-processing functions improve the results using global adjustment (bundling), stray point removal and color adjustment.

There is no limit for the scene size – except disk space.
